# insurance-prediction-pytorch
Linear regression for insurance app using pytorch.

In this project we used specific information like a person's age, sex, BMI, no. of children and smoking habit to predict the price of yearly medical bills. This kind of model is useful for insurance companies to determine the yearly insurance premium for a person. The dataset for this problem is taken from Kaggle.

We have simplified the problem by breaking the solution into a series of steps:

- Download and explore the dataset
- Prepare the dataset for training
- Create a linear regression model
- Train the model to fit the data
- Make predictions using the trained model
